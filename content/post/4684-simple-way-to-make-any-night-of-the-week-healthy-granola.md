- "1/2 cup brown sugar or more if you like a sweeter mix"
- "1/2 cup clear honey"
- "1 nectarine"
- "2 cup mixed dried fruit  I used extra large sultanas raisins and cranberries  i have previously used apricots dates and various nuts and seeds its all about your tastebuds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 180º gas mark 4"
- "Using a medium sized pan - Melt butter, sugar and honey on a medium heat until bubbling but not browning"
- "Whilst waiting for the butter mix, chop the nectarine into small cubes"
- "Add oats to the pan and stir until covered"
- "Lightly stir in the nectarine pieces (you don&#39;t want them to get crushed)"
- "Pour all of it onto a baking sheet covered with greaseproof paper"
- "Spread out but don&#39;t crush it down too far as you want some larger lumps. Put in the oven on a middle shelf and bake for 20 minutes"
- "Remove from oven and allow to cool on the tray.  Remove any bits that may have over-browned so far as to be one step away from blackened - these add a bitter edge, although the chickens love them!"

- "Your granola is now finished. Keep in an airtight container. You can make smaller quantities if you wish but I wouldn&#39;t advise making more as granola will only keep fresh a few days (especially if you&#39;re using fresh fruit)"
- "Have it as cereal with milk. Sprinkled on top of porridge or mixed with yoghurt and banana for a lovely healthy lunch."
- "Lastly, leave out the fresh fruit add another ¼ cup butter, add plump dried fruits when the mix is still warm from the oven and press the mixture into a pie tin or a glass serving dish. Mix together an 8 oz pack of cream cheese, ¼ cup of sugar, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Spread on top of the pressed granola and put back into the oven for 12 minutes, remove, leave to cool then refrigerate for at least 2 hours - cut into squares or serve straight from dish - this is my higgledy piggledy cheesecake"
