- " Egg Yolk"

recipeinstructions:
- "For the cake: whisk eggs and both types of sugar until pale and frothy. Whisk in milk and oil. Stir in baking powder and flour until just combined. Bake in a 30×45 cm cake pan in a 180°C oven for 20 min or until golden around the edges. Cake may appear undercooked because it is so soft, but avoid overbaking it"
- "For the cream: combine pudding mix, sugar, heavy cream and 50 ml of milk. Stir until no lumps remain. Next, bring the remaining milk (300 ml) to the boil, add the pudding mixture and cook for 5-10 min over a low heat or until thickened (stir continously). Let cool for a few minutes then spread over the cake"
- "For the decoration: peel your fruit and cut in half vertically, so you&#39;ll be left with a middle bit with the stone and two half moon slices (for each peach). Round the edges with a knife to resemble the yolk. Put on top of your cake (pudding should be slightly warm but not liquid anymore). Serve cold, enjoy :)"
