recipeingredient:
- "4 Chicken drumettes  the first thickest joint of a chicken wing"
- "10 cm Daikon radish"
- "2 clove Garlic"
- "1 tbsp of each Sugar gochujang miso soy sauce"
- "1 dash of each Sesame oil ground sesame seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the surface of the chicken drumettes by dipping them quickly in boiling water. Peel the daikon radish, cut into quarters lengthwise and slice 2 cm thick (into bite-sized pieces). Crush the garlic."
- "Put all the Step 1 ingredients in a pan, add barely enough water to cover them plus the sugar, and heat over medium-high heat. When it comes to a boil turn the heat down to low and simmer for about 10 minutes."
- "Add the gochujang, miso and soy sauce. Cover with a small lid or parchment paper or foil that sits directly on the pan contents (drop lid or otoshibuta) and simmer for another 10 to 15 minutes. If you mix the flavoring ingredients in some of the cooking liquid before adding it to the pan, they will dissolve easier."
- "Turn the heat up to evaporate the cooking liquid at the end, and add the sesame oil. Transfer to a serving plate and scatter one some ground sesame seeds. You can save the cooking liquid to use in another dish."
- "Other ingredients: mid-part of chicken wings, beef tendon, pork belly, burdock root, potatoes, atsuage, konnyaku. I recommend combining umami-rich meat with ingredients that can absorb that umami!"
- "Re-using the cooking liquid: If you chill the cooking liquid in the refrigerator overnight it will become gelatinous. Use it in miso soup, miso ramen, yakisoba (pan-fried noodles), fried rice, stir fries and so on."
- "Or you could combine the liquid with an equal amount of mayonnaise, thin it out with milk and use as a Korean style mayo-sauce. I used it as a sauce for kalamari."
