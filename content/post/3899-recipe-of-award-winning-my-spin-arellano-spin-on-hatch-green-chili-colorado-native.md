recipeinstructions:
- "In a very large and tall chili pot (stockpot) cook your hamburger and season well with all seasonings except garlic clove."
- "Once hamburger is cooked add hatch green chilies, garlic cloves, jalapeno, and habenero on medium high heat and cook for 3 to 5 min stirring occasionally. Add seasonings to taste. All of them."
- "Add broth then hominy, and beans, bring to boil, then med high for a med boil. 30 to 45 min stirring occasionally. You want all the flavors to come out and hominy and beans (if you didn&#39;t make homemade) to cook. If 12 cups of broth isn&#39;t enough to where you can boil with room add water or more broth till it is."
- "In a glass or measuring cup add 2 qty 1/4 cup of flour, seasoned salt to not dull your chili flavor out with flour taste, and add COLD water to it until in between thick and runny to make rue. Becarful with this. It is to make your chili thicker or to whatever consistency you want. Repeat if you need it more thick. If you get too thick add water to your chili."
- "Turn chili to a simmer and stir consistently and let chili settle. Serve up!"
- "Now, if you make your own beans I use the bean broth for some of the chicken broth. Cause I cook my beans in 32oz/4cups of chicken broth. I just dump my crock pot of beans in the pot when it&#39;s time to add broth amd beans. It makes it so much more flavorful cause its been slow cooking in spices already. I will post my recipe for the best (in my opinion) crockpot pinto beans."
- "I apologize for all the to taste on the seasonings. I&#39;ve just never been one to measure. I&#39;m more of a taster, or my family is. I ask them what does it need. I&#39;m always careful with the seasoned salt though."
