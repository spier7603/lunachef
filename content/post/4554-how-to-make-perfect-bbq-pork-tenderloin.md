recipeinstructions:
- "Wash vegetables. Mince garlic, Grate ginger, slice the peppers, etc. This isn’t your first rodeo. Put the prepared ingredients into a bowl and whisk vigorously and throughly. Add to a large plastic bag. Pierce your meat, the pork, with a fork all over. Add it to the plastic bag. Ideally, you can let it sit for an hour, flip the bag and let it sit another hour, then grill."
- "Place the pork on a hot grill, preferably a charcoal grill... Folks, that’s pretty much it. Do not cook the pork over direct fire. Make sure the coals are hot. Be patient and flip periodically to insure it doesn’t burn."
- "Ignore the steak, that’s just something else. The hotdogs too, they were for my nephew. The tenderloin took roughly 45 minutes to cook. I took it off at an internal temperature of 155 F. They say 145 F is acceptable. There is a slight hint i of pink in the middle. Allow it to rest for about ten minutes under foil before slicing."
- "Slice and plate. Be sure to spoon any juices over the top. Because it was cooked slowly, it was incredibly moist. They, the food gods, say pork pairs well with fruit flavors. I added some sliced grapes as a garnish. I figured I’d garnish with some steak as well. Haha!"
