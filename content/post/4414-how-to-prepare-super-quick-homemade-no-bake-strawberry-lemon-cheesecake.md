recipeingredient:
- " For the crust"
- "10-12 digestive cookies or graham cracker"
- "1 tbsp granulated sugar"
- "5 tbsp melted butter"
- " For cheesecake filling"
- "1/3 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 pack Philadelphia cream cheese at room temperature"
- "200 ml whipping cream"
- "3 tbsp lemon juice"
- " Zest of 1 lemon"
- "4 grams powdered gelatin"
- "2 tbsp boiling hot water"
- " Topping"
- " Lots of strawberries"
- " Or whatever fruit you fancy  "
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the crackers into a ziplock bag and crush them into crumbs. Add melted butter and granulated sugar. The consistency should be like wet sand."
- "Line the pan of your choice with parchment paper, and pour the cracker crumbs into it, press down tightly with a spoon to form the base for the crust. Set aside."
- "In a bowl, beat the whipping cream until it can stand alone (until it is like whipped cream texture). Be careful not to overwhip, because the cream will start to separate into fats and whey. Set the whipped cream aside."
- "In a separate bowl, beat the granulated sugar with the cream cheese until well combined. Add in lemon juice and lemon zest."
- "Mix together the powdered gelatin with the hot water until it is well dissolved (make sure there are no lumps), and pour into the cream cheese mixture. Mix well."
- "Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. Make sure to gently mix, otherwise the cake will not be light and airy. Once well mixed, pour into the pan that holds the already made crust."
- "Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or over night. Then slice up some strawberries or fruits of your choice and decorate the top! Enjoy!"
