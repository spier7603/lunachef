recipeingredient:
- " Fresh apricots three or four per person"
- " Butter or nondairy alternative coconut oil would work well here"
- " Ground almonds"
- " Light brown sugar"
- " Spices such as cinnamon if you fancy"
- " Plain yoghurt or nondairy alternative"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200C."
- "Halve and stone the apricots and nestle them upright into an ovenproof dish so that they&#39;re holding each other up."
- "Into each of the little wells, slide a small blob of butter or alternative. You don&#39;t need loads, about 1/4 tsp for each will do."
- "In a separate bowl, mix together equal quantities of almonds and sugar. For a punnet of apricots, I used two large dessertspoons of each. Add spice to taste at this stage."
- "Scatter the almond/sugar mixture over the fruit. You&#39;re creating a pseudo crumble so you&#39;ll want to be fairly generous."
- "Put the apricots into the oven for 20-30 minutes. Check on them before they fall apart. You want them just on the verge (sounds familiar!)."
- "Serve with small bowlfuls of yoghurt, with a little vanilla powder (my favourite) stirred through if you like, and plenty of hot tea. Follow the light around the house and eat next to a sunny window if you can."
