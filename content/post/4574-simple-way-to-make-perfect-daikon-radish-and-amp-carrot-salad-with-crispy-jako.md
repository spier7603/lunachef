- "4 handfuls  Chirimen jako"
- "1 small packet Bonito flakes"
- "1 pinch Green onion to garnish optional"

recipeinstructions:
- "These are all of the ingredients. I used frozen jako and green onions. You don&#39;t need to defrost, they can be added to the oil frozen! Be careful of the splashing oil!"
- "Warm up the ★ oil and fry the jako. Stir continuously. Once they become nicely browned, move them to paper towel to remove the excess oil."
- "Slice the daikon and carrot into very thin strips. First use a slicer to get 1 mm slices. Since you want to cut against the grain for the daikon, first slice into rounds."
- "Then use a knife to cut very thin strips. If you cut like this, the length of the daikon won&#39;t be uniform, but they will be crunchy."
- "Soak the strips in cold water for a short time. Once they become crunchy, drain the water."
- "Arrange on a plate. First place the daikon and carrot. Then the green onion, then bonito flakes, followed by the jako to make a sort of mountain Dress with your choice of dressing."
- "I recommend using my, &#34;Japanese-Style Sesame Dressing!&#34;  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143944-japanese-style-sesame-dressing-for-myself"
- "By the way, I used this type of slicer. You can adjust the thickness of the slices with the screw on the bottom. There are also 3 types of blades which makes it so convenient. I love this slicer. It surpasses any other."
