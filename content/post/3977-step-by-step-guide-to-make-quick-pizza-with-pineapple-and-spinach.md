I make pizza about once a week, and generally we do the exact same thing: andouille sausage, spinach, pineapple, and plenty of cheese.

I make pizza about once a week, and generally we do the exact same thing: andouille sausage, spinach, pineapple, and plenty of cheese. Which is weird, because as a kid I strongly disliked pizza with sausage and/or pineapple on it. Sometimes I swap the sausage for bacon. Pizza dough topped with some combo of garlic, basil, black olives, spinach, and cheese atop a white sauce may or may not be pizza. It is one tiny step closer to admitting pineapple gracefully; but there is not a food in that list of toppings that goes well with pineapple.
