Duck à l&#39;orange is a classic French recipe featuring a whole roasted duck with crispy, crackling skin along with an aromatic sweet-sour sauce known as sauce bigarade. The original sauce bigarade is made with bitter oranges (sometimes called bigarade oranges, sour oranges, or Seville oranges). Because a single duck rarely has enough meat to feed more than two or three people, Jacques Pépin prepares two ducks side by side when serving this classic dish to guests. Duck a l&#39;orange is possibly one of the most copied French recipes of all time. Orange matches well with duck, as the citrus cuts through any fattiness, yet it remains sweet, unlike lemon.
