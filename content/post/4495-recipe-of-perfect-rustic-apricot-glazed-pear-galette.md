- "Dot the pears with chunks of the butter. Drizzle warmed (in microwave is fine) apricot jam on pear slices. (A dash of cinnamon too if you&#39;re in the mood)"
- "Lightly brush the top of your crust with egg wash. And bake for about an hour till crust is golden brown and pears are soft."
- "Remove from oven and allow to cool before eating. Take care when handling the crust it is flaky/ crumbly and oh so delicious."
- "Bon appetit! I hope you enjoy this French tart with your clann. Don&#39;t forget to post your pics too."
