recipeingredient:
- "50 grams Kiriboshi daikon"
- "2 blocks Koya dofu"
- "5 cm Kombu thin type"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tsp Vegetable oil or sesame oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the kiriboshi daikon briskly, but don&#39;t soak in water. Cut it up roughly. Cut the kombu thinly using kitchen scissors."
- "Soak the koya tofu in 70°C or so hot water for 30 minutes to rehydrate. Cut into 5 pieces lengthwise, and then slice thinly."
- "Heat a thick bottom pot. Add the vegetable oil and 1 pinch of salt, and stir fry the kiriboshi daikon. When the kiriboshi daikon is coated with oil, add just enough water to submerge. Add the thinly cut kombu as well. Bring to a boil."

- "Take the lid off once there&#39;s just a little moisture left in the pan. Be careful not to let it burn. Don&#39;t boil off all the moisture, or else the dish will become dried out."
