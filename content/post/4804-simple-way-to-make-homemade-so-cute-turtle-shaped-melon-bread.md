Wrap each flattened shell over the top of each bread body neatly. Score in some lines with a scraper to create the traditional melon bread lattice pattern and attach the feet and head to the body by using beaten egg whites as a kind of glue."
- "Please make sure that the turtle heads are bigger than the feet. They should look a bit like this photo. Cover loosely with cling film and allow to prove for a second time somewhere warm for 40 minutes."
- "Bake for 13 minutes in an oven preheated to 180℃. These turtles tend to burn easily so please keep an eye on them."
- "Once baked, leave to cool on a rack."
- "Make some eyes with some melted white chocolate and chocolate chips. Use the blunt end of a skewer to attach the eyes and once dry you&#39;re done."
