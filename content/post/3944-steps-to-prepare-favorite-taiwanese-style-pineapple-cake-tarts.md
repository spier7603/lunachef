- "2 pineapples"
- "1 tbs corn syrup or substitute"
- "1 tbs honey"
- "1/2 cup brown sugar"
- "1 3/4 cup cake flour"
- "1/4 cup confectioners sugar"
- "1/4 cup dry milk powder"
- "1 stick (110 g) unsalted melted butter"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 tbs vanilla extract"
- "1 egg"
recipeinstructions:
- "Core pineapple and cut into small pieces. Blend them into a paste, then sauté them without oil until they become darker and more paste-like (will take 20-30 minutes). Mix periodically. Optional: add 1 tbs corn syrup and 1 tbs honey to mixture."
- "Let pineapple paste cool in refridgerator for at least 1 hours."
- "Preheat the oven to 170 degrees Celsius."
- "Whisk in a large bowl: 1 1/4 cup cake flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup dry milk powder, 1/4 cup confectioner&#39;s sugar, and 1/2 tsp salt"

- "A buttery dough should eventually form. Keep kneading until the consistency is slightly firm."
- "Take a large tablespoon of dough, flatten it, then place the pineapple paste in the center. Wrap the dough around the paste such that no pineapple paste peeks out. Tip: make the dough as flat and even as possible; 70% of the cake tart should be pineapple paste."
- "Place into a mold (bonus: use a pineapple shape mold) to create a shape, flatten to an even surface, load onto baking tray, and repeat for each."
- "Bake at 170 degrees Celsius for 14"
- "Minutes or until the bottom appears to have browned. Then flip each tart and bake again for 6 minutes or until the bottom appears browned."
- "Cool onto a grill drying rack then serve. Optional: refridgerate for 1-2 days to optimize the flavor of the paste."
