recipeinstructions:
- "In a large oiled pot, brown stew meat on medium high heat. Stir in Rotel tomatoes and broth (I make broth using bullion as I find it to be more flavorful). Add frozen green chilies and condensed chicken soup. Bring to boil. Add jalapenos,  cilantro,  cumin and bay leafs. Reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes. Remove bay leafs and serve over burritos or eat as a stew with tortillas."
