recipeinstructions:
- "Cut bacon while still in the packaging into 1.5 inch long sections. Cook bacon until well done and crispy. Put bacon aside for garnish later. Keep the bacon grease in the pan. (I like to cook at low heat to not get splash and burned. It&#39;s also easier not to burn the bacon) You can cook full length strips and cut into small pieces later but you can fit more in the pan with cutting prior."
- "While bacon is cooking prepare the vegetables and place them in a bowl until bacon is done. You can remove the seeds from the jalapeno or completely omit if you don&#39;t like it spicy."
- "Once all bacon is removed from the pan. Fry vegetables (onions and peppers) until tender. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds more. Remove from heat."
- "Prepare meat. Cube steak into 1/4&#34;-1/2&#34; pieces. Take Italian sausage out of linings and and tear into 3/4&#34;sized pieces. Cut breakfast sausage links into 1/2&#34; lengths. Cut potatoes to 1/2&#34; cubes."
- "Transfer cooked vegetables into large stock pot. Do not strain excess bacon grease from vegetables. You will need a little in the pot to help keep the meat from sticking to the pot. You do not need to spoon it out or pour the grease into the pan. Just the oils that come with the vegetables will be good."
- "Add the meat and potatoes into the vegetables. Brown the meat stiring gently trying not to break up the ground beef into tiny pieces."
- "Once the meat has been cooked add the spices. Chili powder, cayenne, coriander, cumin, granulated garlic, granulated onion, paprika, black pepper, and fennel. Cook until fragrant, about 1 minute."
- "Add tomato sauce, paste, and diced tomatoes. Stir and let cook for for 2 minutes. Add creamed corn, beans, chicken stock and beer. Lower to a simmer and cook for 2 hours."
- "Chop the green onions. Shred the cheese. Put out the sour cream and crackers."
- "Enjoy!"
