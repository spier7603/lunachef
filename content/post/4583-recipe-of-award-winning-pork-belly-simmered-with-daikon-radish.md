recipeingredient:
- "600 grams Pork belly"
- "120 ml Sake"
- "3 tbsp Mirin"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons Sugar"
- "5 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "600 ml Water"
- "1/2 Daikon radish"
- "4 Boiled eggs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up a frying pan without oil and brown the pork on all sides over medium-high heat."
- "Add a green onion, ginger and water and cook until a skewer pierces the meat easily (about 1 to 1 1/2 hour, or 15 minutes in a pressure cooker)."
- "Leave it in the pot until the soup cools, then transfer it to a plastic container and put it in the fridge overnight, if possible."
- "Cut up the pork that has chilled overnight (chilling improves the flavor and makes the meat easier to cut). If you&#39;re in a hurry, cut the meat right away, without chilling."
- "Peel the daikon radish, cut it into rounds and shave off the sharp edges, then parboil it. Boil the eggs and peel the shells."
- "Bring the ★ ingredients to a boil in a pot and add the pork, daikon radish and boiled eggs.  Bring it to a boil again, and turn down the heat to low. Put on an otoshibuta drop lid, or a piece of aluminum foil or kitchen parchment paper with several holes punched in it, on top of the simmering food, and cook for 1-1 1/2 hours."
- "It&#39;s done when the meat is tender, the sauce has reduced, and the flavor has soaked in."
- "The solidified fat is good to use for stir-fries or in gyoza. Use the soup from boiling the meat for ramen (it can be frozen)."
- "It&#39;s a matter of preference, but I think this dish tastes better if you flavor it more strongly than you would other simmered dishes."
- "Please check out the flavoring of amberjack daikon as a reference for this recipe. The taste will come out just right (make it with double the amount of water and flavorings if you are basing on this recipe).  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143404-my-familys-easy-simmered-amberjack-daikon-radish"
- "The daikon radish is boiled in the cloudy water left from washing rice, but you can also cook it in the microwave. See  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/143402-parboil-daikon-in-the-microwave"
