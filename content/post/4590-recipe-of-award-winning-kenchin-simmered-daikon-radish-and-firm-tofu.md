recipeingredient:
- "1/2 Daikon radish"
- "1 block Firm tofu"
- "30 shakes Umami seasoning"
- "2 1/2 tbsp Usukuchi soy sauce"
- "1/2 tbsp Mirin"
- "2 tbsp Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Open the package of tofu, drain the water inside and keep draining it until it&#39;s time to use it. Drain any water that collects on it again before using it."
- "Cut the daikon radish into chunks. My mother-in-law cuts it on the diagonal, using a knife to slice and drop the daikon directly into the pot in Step 7."
- "Heat a pot and add the vegetable oil. The tofu will splatter when you put it in, so lay the tofu on the lid of the pot and quickly turn it over into the pot. Leave the lid on and brown the tofu."
- "When it stops spitting, take the lid off, turn over the tofu and brown the other side. Don&#39;t worry if it has dark brown bits on it."
- "When it&#39;s browned on both sides, break the tofu up and stir-fry it. The tofu will stick together and form lumps as it heats."
- "Stir-fry  the tofu until it&#39;s crumbly, then move it to the side of the pot."
- "Add in the daikon radish to the other side."
- "Spoon the tofu on top of the daikon and add the usukuchi soy sauce. Cover and cook over medium heat. Liquid will come out of the tofu and daikon, so you don&#39;t need to add water."
- "When it comes to a boil, stir it all up, cover with a lid again, and simmer over medium-low heat for 10-15 minutes, being careful not to let it burn."
- "When the radish is cooked, add the mirin, replace the lid and simmer for 10-15 minutes."
- "How much liquid there is depends on the daikon radish, but this shows just how much liquid came out."
- "Ready to serve."
