recipeingredient:
- "1 very ripe pineapple"
- "1 pork tenderloin rub of your choice"
- "8 toothpicks"
- "1 metal bowl"
- "1 plastic wrap"
- "1 tong"
- "1 plate or pan"
- "1 knife"
- "1 spoon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the top off of your pineapple, using a knife and spoon, remove the insides. Try to leave 3/4&#34; of pineapple for your sides"
- "Open your tenderloin and remove as much fat as possible."
- "After all the fat is removed, cut the loin in half and stuff inside the pineapple"
- "Place the pineapple top back on and use your toothpicks to hold the top on. Leave 1/2&#34; of the toothpick exposed. Easier to remove when the loin is done."
- "I placed my pineapple in a metal bowl, covered with plastic wrap and placed back into the refrigerator to let the loin marinate with the pineapple overnight."
- "Since I had to work late, smoking the loin was out of the question. So grilling my Swineapple it was. Using my 4 burner propane grill, I kept the 2 burners under the pineapple on low. The next burner I set half way and the farthest away burner I had on high. This method took exactly 2h15mins. I probed the side of the pineapple and a perfect 165°."
- "After removing the loin from the grill, I waited 20 mins before I took the top of the pineapple off. Cut your slices and enjoy! The loin was spicey, sweet and so tender. No knife need to eat the loin."
