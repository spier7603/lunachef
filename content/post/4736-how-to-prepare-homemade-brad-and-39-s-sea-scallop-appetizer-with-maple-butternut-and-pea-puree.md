recipeinstructions:
- "Start 2 pans of water on to boil for the purees. Boil squash and peas separately until they are tender."
- "To make the purees, drain squash and peas separately. In a blender add ingredients for the squash puree. The squash and peas should be hot when you blend them. Pulse a couple times. Turn blender to liquefy and slowly add hot water until puree becomes very smooth and silky. Taste and adjust seasonings to your liking. Repeat with the peas. They will take considerably less water to make smooth."

- "Cut scallops in half so they will cook evenly. Pat dry with paper towels."
- "When pan is hot add about 1 tbs olive oil per batch of scallops. Put scallops in pan. Lay them away from you. Immediately salt them. They should only need about 90-100 seconds per side. If doing more than 1 batch, clean pan between batches. Drain on paper towels for a minute when done."
- "For plating, either mimic the picture or arrange in your own style. Garnish with a small piece of bacon. Serve immediately. Enjoy."
