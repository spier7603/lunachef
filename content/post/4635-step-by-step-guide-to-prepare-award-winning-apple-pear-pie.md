recipeingredient:
- "1/2 lemon for zest"
- "5 baking apples granny smith etc peeled cored sliced"
- "4 baking pears bosc etc peeled cored sliced"
- "2/3 cup brown sugar"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "1/2 teaspoon ground ginger"
- "1/4 teaspoon fine salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg"
- "1 cup golden raisins soaked in brandy optional"
- "1/4 cup unsalted butter 12 stick"
- "1 tablespoon fruit jam  preserve clear such as apricot etc"
- "1/4 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract"
- "1 large egg beaten for egg wash"
- "2 storebought pie crusts follow package instructions for use"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the filling: Finely grate the lemon zest and set aside. Peel, core and then slice both the apples and pears into 1/2-inch slices. Coarsely chop the slices. Squeeze the lemon juice over the fruit then toss fruit with the sugar, cinnamon, ginger, salt and nutmeg. Mix in the raisins."
- "Melt the butter in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fruit and cook, stirring until the sugar dissolves and juices simmer, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, add the fruit jam (optional), and cook uncovered, until the fruit softens and the juices evaporate some, about 10 minutes."
- "Evenly mix the flour into the fruit; then cook about a 2 minutes more to thicken the juices slightly. Stir in the vanilla and lemon zest; and remove from the heat. (The filling should resemble tight compote.) Cool completely."
- "Form the pie: Transfer one prepared pie dough sheet from a lightly flour dusted surface area to 9-inch pie pan, so it hangs about 1/2-inch over the edge of the pan. Fill the crust with the prepared fruit so it mounds slightly in the center."
- "Roll the other dough sheet onto the dusted rolling pin and unroll it over the fruit so it hangs over the edge of the pie pan by about 1/2-inch. Trim crusts evenly with a knife and press both top and bottom edges to seal. Flute the crust edge with a fork or fingers to make an even impression. Refrigerate the pie for at least 20 minutes."
- "Place the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and heat to 400 degrees F."
- "Brush pie with egg wash and sprinkle with white sugar on top if desired. Cut 6 to 8 small steam vents into the top of the pie dough. Place pie on a baking sheet (drippings) and bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375 degrees F."
- "Bake for another 45-50 minutes until the crust is golden brown. If the edges begin to brown too quickly, cut a pie crust shield out of a piece of aluminum foil and cover the edges. When done baking, cool on a rack for 1-2 hours."
- "Tip: Serve with ice-cream of course."
