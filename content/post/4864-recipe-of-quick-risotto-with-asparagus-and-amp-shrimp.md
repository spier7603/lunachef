- "3/4 cup quality rice"
- "half a bunch asparagus"
- "1/2 cup shrimp"
- " olive oil"
- "1/4 red onion"
- " Optional garlic"
- "3/4 cup Parmigiano"
- "2-3 cups vegetable broth"
- "Splash white wine"
- " Optional Decoration Parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the vegetables and shrimp for cooking. I liked the onion and garlic to be shredded, so that they blend in with the asparagus."
- "Fry asparagus, onion and garlic for just a few minutes. (I left the delicate top pieces of the asparagus aside, as they really only need a minute to be cooked in the end with the rice). Prepare the vegetable broth, and keep it warm. I dropped into the vegetable broth some of the harder asparagus pieces, to give it extra flavor."
- "Start cooking the rice: keep it under the boiling vegetable broth the whole time, stirring often. It takes about 17-20 minutes for the rice to get thick. I added a splash of white wine towards the end."
- "Add in the asparagus, shrimp, and Parmigiano cheese. I was surprised: given the cheese, I really didn&#39;t feel like it needed any extra salt at all. I like my risotto pretty &#34;liquid&#34; (is that the correct word?), so I kept adding spoonfuls of the broth and white wine until the cheese and everything had melted properly together."
- "Serve immediately :-)"
