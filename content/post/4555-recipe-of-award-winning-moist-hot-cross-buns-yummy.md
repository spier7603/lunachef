recipeinstructions:
- "Bring 300ml full-fat milk to the boil, then remove from the heat and add 50g butter. Leave to cool until it reaches temperature that feels warm only. Put 500g strong bread flour, 1 tsp salt, 75g caster sugar and 7g sachet fast-action or easy-blend yeast into a bowl. Make a well in the centre. Pour in the warm milk and butter mixture, then add 1 beaten egg. Using Spoon mix well, then bring everything together with your hands until you have a sticky dough."
- "Turn mixture on to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough with one hand and stretching it with the heal of the other hand, then folding it back on itself. Repeat for 5 mins until smooth and elastic. Put the dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with cling film and leave to rise in a warm place for 1 hr or until doubled in size."
- "Add in 75g sultanas, 50g mixed peel, zest of 1 orange, 1 finely chopped apple and 1 tsp ground cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger tipout and Knead into the dough, making sure everything is well distributed. Leave to rise for 1 hr more, or until doubled in size, covered by some well-oiled cling film."
- "Divide the dough into 16 even pieces (about 70g per piece). Roll each piece into a smooth ball on a lightly floured work surface. Arrange the buns on one or two baking trays lined with parchment, leaving enough space for the dough to expand. Cover (but don’t wrap) with more oiled cling film, or a clean tea towel, then set aside to prove for 1 hr more."
- "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. I add some boiling water to the bottom try to keep everything extra moist (Optional)"
- "Mix 75g plain flour with about 5 tbsp water to make the paste for the cross – add the water 4 tbsp Frist time, then add just enough for a thick paste. Spoon into a piping bag with a small nozzle. Pipe a line along each row of buns, then repeat in the other direction to create crosses. Bake for 20 mins on the middle shelf of the oven, until golden brown."
- "Heat 2 tbsp apricot jam with the 1 Tbsp to melt and brush over the top of the warm buns and leave to cool"
- "I cut in Half, Toast then add butter - PERFECT :)"
