recipeingredient:
- "1/2 lb ribeyetenderloin beef"
- " Wasabi optional"
- "4 lettuce leaves optional"
- " Yakiniku Sauce"
- "1/3 cup soy sauce or glutenfree soy sauce"
- "1/4 cup mirin"
- "1/8 cup honey"
- "1/8 cup sugar"
- "1/8 cup orange juice"
- "1/8 cup sake"
- "1 cup grated apple"
- "1 tbsp grated ginger"
- "1 tbsp grated garlic"
- "1 tbsp sesame seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, you need to grate some ginger, garlic, and apple."
- "How you slice your meat really depends on the cut of meat that you have. Yakiniku meat is usually cut up into smaller pieces, which is the perfect size for one bite. I’m cutting each piece of the meat about 1/4 inch thick and about 1.5” to 2” lengthwise. You can freeze the meat for about 30 minutes and that will make slicing easier."
- "Chop some red-leaf lettuce. Veggies are optional. Some people just eat rice with the yakiniku meat. Other veggies you can use are iceberg or green leaf lettuce, sliced cucumbers, or steamed broccoli."
- "In a pan, combine 1/3 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of mirin, 1/8 cup of honey, 1/8 cup of sugar, and 1/8 cup of sake. Turn on the heat and boil until the sugar is all dissolved.   When the sauce is done, turn off the heat and let the sauce cool for about 15 minutes"
- "Mix in 1 tbsp of orange juice, 1 tbsp of grated ginger, 1 tbsp of grated garlic, and 1 tbsp of grated apple. And add 1 tbsp of sesame seeds.  Not boiling these ingredients will maintain their optimum flavor.  However, if you want to keep this sauce for up to two weeks, make sure to also boil orange juice, grated ginger, garlic, and apple. These fresh ingredients are perishable so boiling them will help extend the shelf life of the sauce."
- "Grill the meat on both sides. Depending on how cooked you want your meat to be, grilling time will differ. I usually grill for about 30 seconds on each side. That makes the meat almost well done but still tender.  If you freeze the meat before cutting, just make sure to let them warm up to room temp before grilling"
- "To serve, create a bed of rice in your serving bowl. If you choose to have veggies, then lay some down in the center of the rice bed. Add a few pieces of grill meat on the top. Garnish with some sesame seed. Lastly, drizzle the yakiniku sauce, and there you have it."
