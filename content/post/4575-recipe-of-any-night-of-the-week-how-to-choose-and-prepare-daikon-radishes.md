- " Toothpicks optional"
- "1 tsp White rice"
recipeinstructions:
- "How to chose a good daikon radish:  Look at the small holes at the bottom of the daikon radish. Are they all lined up? That&#39;s a sign that this daikon grew healthily, without any stress."
- "Cut the daikon radish into 3-4 cm thick slices. Use the top 2/3 of the daikon for simmering dishes.  The bottom part is spicier, so it&#39;s more suitable for grated daikon dishes!"
- "Look closely and you will see the fibrous part changes at about 5 mm from the skin. That&#39;s the part you need to peel off."
- "There&#39;s a trick to peeling the skin... just try it out for yourself and see: First, make a slit with a toothpick the size you see in the photo.  You can cut it with a knife also."
- "Got it? It should look like this."
- "Now it&#39;s time for Hand Power! That sounds like a popular Japanese magician&#39;s old catchphrase, but really, you can peel it with your hand!"
- "Look! It comes off so smoothly! If you are worried about your nails, use a spoon."
- "It&#39;s done!  Isn&#39;t it amazing?  You can peel the skin along the line described in Step 3!  This is a characteristic of the daikon radish."
- "To prevent the daikon from falling apart during simmering, shave off the sharp edge on both sides.  You can also use a peeler of course."
- "In this photo, the right side is smaller than the left side, so it&#39;s going to touch the plate when it is served. That means you should make slits on this side."
- "Score it crosswise: Make a crisscross incision with a knife.  The depth should be about 5-10 mm.  These slits let the taste penetrate inside."
- "That&#39;s how it&#39;s done! Impressive, huh? After this, start boiling them with the crisscross side down."
- "Place the daikon radish inside a skillet and pour in just enough water to cover the daikon. Then add a teaspoon of rice..."
- "Heat the frying pan just until the water starts boiling, then simmer it slowly for 30 minutes!  This is called &#34;pocher&#34; in French."
- "After 30 minutes, rinse the daikon under running water to remove the stickiness on the surface."
- "They&#39;re done! Now use them in your favorite dishes!  The taste will be so much better!"
